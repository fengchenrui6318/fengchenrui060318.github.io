<p>Hello</p>
<p>My name is Feng Chenrui.</p>
<p>I am a Han girl from Suzhou, Jiangsu Province.</p>
<p>I am currently studying in the School of Sociology, Soochow University, majoring in archival science.</p>
<p>I am good at all kinds of basic office software and scenario writing.</p>
<p>I like table tennis, traveling and music.</p>
<p>I think table tennis can help me exercise my body and enhance my flexibility. In addition, practicing table tennis with friends can enhance our friendship and cooperation spirit.</p>
<p>In the process of traveling, I experienced the local customs of different regions, saw the landform landscape created by different climate environment, and felt the culture and tradition of different regions.</p>
<p>Listening to music can make me relax and forget my fatigue. I can also feel the composer's feelings and the story behind the song from the melody of the music.</p>
<p>I studied in the Affiliated Primary School of Xinsu Normal School in Jiangsu Province, the middle school in Suzhou Nanhuan Experimental High School, the high school in Suzhou Affiliated High School of Xi 'an Jiaotong University, and the university in Soochow University.</p>
<p>I am careful and rigorous in my work, gentle and kind, and ready to help others. I also like to make friends with people from different majors and backgrounds.</p>
